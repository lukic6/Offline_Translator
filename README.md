# Offline_Translator
Translator you can use on a go without an internet connection (if previously downloaded).

The initial 2 files are required for translator to be working. You input the message that you want to be translated into test.txt file.
After that you just go into script.py and you just change the language you want your message to be translated to; translator = Translator(to_lang=" !!! ").
